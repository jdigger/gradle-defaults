== Language Support

=== Java

If the `java` plugin is applied:

* Add tasks and artifacts for `-sources.jar` and `-javadoc.jar`.
* Sets the compiler target and source compatibility versions based on the `defaults.compatibilityVersion` (defaults
  to the version of Java used to compile)
* Configures the JAR MANIFEST.MF to include
** Implementation-Title = `{project.description ?: project.name}`
** Implementation-Version = `{project.version}`
** Built-By = `{userEmail as known to git's "user.email" configuration}`
** Built-Date = `{now}`
** Built-JDK = `{System.getProperty('java.version')}`
** Built-Gradle = `{Gradle version being used}`

==== Lombok

Adds support for https://projectlombok.org/[Lombok] for Java projects. If a project has Java code it is assumed to
need Lombok, unless it is explicitly disabled with `lombok.enabled = false`.

You can change the version of Lombok to use by setting `lombok.version`. The current default is "1.16.8".

Both compiling from Gradle and IntelliJ IDEA projects are supported.

==== Checker Framework

Adds support for http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/[Checker Framework] for Java projects.
If a project has Java code it is assumed to need Checker Framework, unless it is explicitly disabled
with `checkerFramework.enabled = false`.

You can change the version of Lombok to use by setting `checkerFramework.version`. The current default is "2.0.1".

Both compiling from Gradle and IntelliJ IDEA projects are supported.

=== Groovy

If the `groovy` plugin is applied:

* Adds tasks and artifacts for `-groovydoc.jar`.
* Sets the compiler target and source compatibility versions based on the `defaults.compatibilityVersion` (defaults
  to the version of Java used to compile)

=== Scala

If the `scala` plugin is applied:

* Adds tasks and artifacts for `-scaladoc.jar`.
* Sets the compiler target and source compatibility versions based on the `defaults.compatibilityVersion` (defaults
  to the version of Java used to compile)

=== Kotlin

If the `kotlin` plugin (`org.jetbrains.kotlin:kotlin-gradle-plugin`) is applied:

* Adds tasks and artifacts for `-dokka.jar` if the https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/kotlin-doc.html[Dokka]
  plugin has also been applied
* Sets the compiler target and source compatibility versions based on the `defaults.compatibilityVersion` (defaults
  to the version of Java used to compile)


== Publishing & Releasing

=== GitHub Pages

Applies https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git[`org.ajoberstar.github-pages`] plugin.

Will publish content from `src/gh-pages`. In addition, will generate and publish API documentation for Java, Scala,
Groovy and Kotlin.

=== Licensing

If the `openSource` property is set to true (either against the project or the `defaults` extension), the
https://github.com/hierynomus/license-gradle-plugin[license plugin] (`com.github.hierynomus.license`) is applied.

It uses the license header from `gradle/HEADER`, injecting `defaults.copyrightYears` for `${year}` in the header.

Strict checking (fail a `check` if all needed files do not have license information) is enabled.

Sets `.java`, `.groovy`, `.scala` and `.kt` files to use slashstar style (`/* \*/`) instead of default
javadoc (`/** */`) style for the license header.

Properties files are excluded from checks.

=== Release Plugin

The https://github.com/ajoberstar/gradle-git[`org.ajoberstar.release-opinion`] plugin is applied.

The `release` task depends on `clean`, `build` and `publishGhPages`, as well as `bintrayUpload` if BinTray is being used.

=== Maven Publishing

The `maven-publish` plugin is applied and the `main` publication includes any of the following that exist:

* `.jar`
* `-sources.jar`
* `-javadoc.jar`
* `-groovydoc.jar`
* `-scaladoc.jar`
* `-dokka.jar`

The POM is configured with information from the project and link:dokka/gradle-defaults/com.mooregreatsoftware.gradle.defaults/-defaults-extension/index.html[the "defaults" extension, see its Javadoc].

MavenLocal is added as a publishing location.

=== BinTray

If https://github.com/bintray/gradle-bintray-plugin[`com.jfrog.bintray`] is applied and `bintrayUser` and `bintrayKey` properties are set on the project, then the following configuration is set in addition to any that the build file explicitly configures:

If `defaults.bintrayLabels` includes `gradle`, the `gradle-plugin` attribute is set to support the Gradle plugin portal for any plugin IDs in `src/main/resources`.

The `main` publication from "Maven Publishing" is published to the BinTray repository.

The BinTray project is configured with information from the project and link:dokka/gradle-defaults/com.mooregreatsoftware.gradle.defaults/-defaults-extension/index.html[the "defaults" extension, see its Javadoc].


== Development

=== IntelliJ IDEA

Applies the `idea` plugin.

* Initializes Git as the VCS
* Sets the language level to `defaults.compatibilityVersion`
* Code formatting set to reasonable/consistent standards

=== Misc

* Adds the `jcenter()` repository.
* Configures ordering rules for tasks:
** All tasks should run after `clean`.
** All tasks in the `publishing` group should run after `build`.
