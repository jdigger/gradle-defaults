= Lombok
:icons: font
:mainSrcDir: ../src/main/kotlin

== Usage

[source,groovy]
apply plugin: "com.mooregreatsoftware.lombok"

== Description

Adds support for https://projectlombok.org/[Lombok] for Java projects.

You can change the version of Lombok to use by setting `lombok.version` on the project. The current default is:
[source,java]
--
include::{mainSrcDir}/com/mooregreatsoftware/gradle/lombok/LombokExtension.java[tags="default_version"]
--

The dependency is set as "compile only", so it won't show up in generated artifacts.

This automatically applies the <<java-plugin.adoc#,"com.mooregreatsoftware.java" plugin>>.
If the "org.gradle.idea" plugin is used, the <<idea-plugin.adoc#,"com.mooregreatsoftware.idea" plugin>> is also added.
This ensures that compiling is properly supported by both Gradle and IntelliJ even if there are other annotation
processors on the classpath.

[NOTE]
--
You should make sure to still install the Lombok plugin for IntelliJ. Compiling would work without the IDE plugin, but
the editor will be confused by things like `val`.
