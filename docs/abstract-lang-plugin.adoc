* Add task and artifact for `-sources.jar`.
* Sets the compiler target and source compatibility versions based on the `defaults.compatibilityVersion` (defaults
  to the version of Java used to compile)
* Configures the MANIFEST.MF of JARs generated to include
** Implementation-Title = `{project.description ?: project.name}`
** Implementation-Version = `{project.version}`
** Built-By = `{userEmail as known to git's "user.email" configuration}`
** Built-Date = `{now}`
** Built-JDK = `{System.getProperty('java.version')}`
** Built-Gradle = `{Gradle version being used}`
* The `mavenLocal()` repository is added to the project.
* Configures the generated POM.XML when publishing to include
** <name> = `project.name}`
** group = `{project.group ?: see below}`
** version = `{project.description ?: project.name}`
** <description> = `{project.description}` if it has been set
** <url> = `{defaults.siteUrl}`
** organization = `{now}`
** licenses = `{System.getProperty('java.version')}`
** developers = `{Gradle version being used}`
** constributors = `{Gradle version being used}`
** scm = `{Gradle version being used}`

If `project.group` is not set, this tries to make a "`reasonable guess`". It does so by scanning the source code of
the project (`.java`, `.groovy`, `.scala`, `.kt`) and searching for the top-level package. For example, if you have
three Java classes, `com.mooregreatsoftware.zzzzzzzgradle.MyClass` and `com.mooregreatsoftware.gradle.defaults.AnotherClass` and `com.mooregreatsoftware.gradle.MyClass`
