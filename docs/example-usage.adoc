== Example Usage

Here's the relevant section of this project's `build.gradle` file:

[source,groovy]
--
include::../build.gradle[tags="buildfile1"]
--

== Notes

For all of the configurable properties of link:dokka/gradle-defaults/com.mooregreatsoftware.gradle.defaults/-defaults-extension/index.html[the "defaults" extension, see its Javadoc].

For now, the three non-MavenLocal repositories are needed in `buildscript` -- at least until this gets into
the Gradle Plugin Repository.

=== Multi-Module Support

You only need to apply the plugin to the root project and it will take care of applying sensible
defaults to all of its children. (In fact, applying it to any project that's not the root does nothing and
a warning is logged.)

Each sub-module receives its own "defaults" extension that can be used to override the settings of its parent.
