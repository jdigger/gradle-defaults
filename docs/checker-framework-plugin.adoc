= Checker Framework
:mainSrcDir: ../src/main/kotlin

== Usage

[source,groovy]
apply plugin: "com.mooregreatsoftware.checker-framework"

== Description

Adds support for http://types.cs.washington.edu/checker-framework/[Checker Framework] for Java projects.

You can change the version to use by setting `checkerFramework.version` on the project. The current default is:
[source,java]
--
include::{mainSrcDir}/com/mooregreatsoftware/gradle/checkerframework/CheckerFrameworkExtension.java[tags="default_version"]
--

The dependency is set as "compile only", so it won't show up in generated artifacts.

This automatically applies the <<java-plugin.adoc#,"com.mooregreatsoftware.java" plugin>>.
If the "org.gradle.idea" plugin is used, the <<idea-plugin.adoc#,"com.mooregreatsoftware.idea" plugin>> is also added.
This ensures that compiling is properly supported by both Gradle and IntelliJ even if there are other annotation
processors on the classpath.
